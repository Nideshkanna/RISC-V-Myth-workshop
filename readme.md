# **RISC-V MYTH Workshop**

Welcome to the **RISC-V MYTH Workshop** repository! ðŸš€

This repository is created as part of the **MYTH (Microprocessors for You in Thirty Hours)** Workshop, focusing on the fundamentals of **RISC-V architecture**, processor design, and hands-on exposure to **RISC-V assembly programming**. 

Over the course of this workshop, we'll be exploring:
- Basics of the RISC-V ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
- Writing and simulating RISC-V assembly code
- Understanding how a simple RISC-V based processor works
- Building and running programs on RISC-V hardware simulators

We will be updating this `README.md` in the upcoming days with:
- Detailed session summaries
- Installation and setup guides
- Code snippets and notes
- Useful references and resources

Stay tuned! ðŸ“šâœ¨
